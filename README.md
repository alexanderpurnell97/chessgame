Making a pretty simple Chess game in my sparetime. This is just for personal progress/fun :)

**To do:**
[x] Create board
[X] Import pieces and make them movable
[] Create ruleset
  [X] Individual piece rules (e.g. blocked by others, can take pieces etc)
  [] Make turn-based
  [] Create check/checkmate (Force a player to move if in check/if player wins include an alert)
[] Make it pretty

**Future/stretch goals**
[] Include a chess clock for optional timed matches
[] Connect to a gpt to assess the game
[] Include other chess variations
